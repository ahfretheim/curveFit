# curveFit
A Python class for finding the nearest parabola to a trendline for a given inflection point. Useful for risk assessment when you think a trend is probably linear but could be parabolic. Keep in mind that if an inflection point is far from the current data, the parabolic trend WOULD NOT look linear, and therefore there is never a reason to test inflection points far from your current data
